#Flutter 

Flutter is an SDK owned by Google to create applications for Android and iOS using a single codebase. Flutter uses the Dart programming language (also owned by Google). Flutter was in alpha when I released this video, so things might still change a bit. But the SDK is already mature enough to write some cool apps!
